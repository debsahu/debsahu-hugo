- Exploiting low light photography with long exposure to paint in thin air using NeoPixels LED strips. 
- Here we send real-time data using the E1.31 sACN protocol to a ESP8266 code: https://github.com/debsahu/E131_PixelPusher that displays strips of pictures over time. 
- These bright lights are registered on the sensors of camera yielding out of the world photos!
