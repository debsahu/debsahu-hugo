Here I add [WiFi LNK module](https://www.rainbird.com/products/lnk-wifi-module) to my [ESP-TM2 Rainbird Irrigation System](https://www.rainbird.com/products/esp-tm2-series-controllers) and add the integration to Home Assistant. Once completed, I winterize the irrigation system for the coming winter.
