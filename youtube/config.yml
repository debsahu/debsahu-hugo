            - During the day, I manage [BioNMR Core facility](https://bionmrcore.umich.edu/) at [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/). I am a trained NMR spectroscopist who likes to utilize wide array of Biophysical techniques to understand protein function. My scientific work includes wide array of research areas ranging from structural biology, di-sulphide bond redox chemistry, protein dynamics, intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) to transcription factor translocation dynamics.

            - ![deb](deb1.jpg) During the night and weekends, one might find me coding [GitHub](https://www.github.com/debsahu) or tinkering with electronics. I have recently taught myself to work with wood and epoxy, while also playing with “smart devices” in the recent years. This has led to the creation of a YouTube Channel.
